# EQILLM
Project focusing on LLM finetuning analysis for emotion recognition. This project focuses on finetuning quantized models in order to achieve quality of responses regarding pathos recognition observe in gpt-4. Additionally, I want to trial-and-error overall pipeline for interacting and improving LLM's.

## Backend
Due to simplicity for now LM Studio is used for running server simulating OpenAI-aike API. For local use it's enough, and provides simplicity of running multiple models quantificatified with different methods 

All responses will be kept in database
